# HackTown 🏘️

> **A living, breathing simulation where AI-powered NPCs think, remember, and interact autonomously in real-time.**

Originally built in 12 hours as an emergent AI experiment, now upgraded with an **emergent physics layer** that lets crowds respond to hunger, danger, and trauma without extra LLM calls. Each NPC has a unique personality, makes decisions with LLM reasoning for dialogue, remembers past interactions, and lives a full lifecycle from birth to death.

## 🎥 Demo

[Demo Video Coming Soon]

**Watch NPCs**:
- 🧠 Think contextually based on personality and memories
- 💬 Have organic conversations and spread gossip
- 😊😐😞 Change color based on mood (green=happy, red=stressed, blue=sad)
- 👶👴 Grow from young (small) to elder (large)
- ⚰️ Die from age, stress, or dangerous events
- 🎭 React to world events (villains, festivals, storms)
- 🌡️ Flow along simulated heat, food, and trauma fields that diffuse across town
- 🌀 Self-organize via utility-driven crowd physics and emotional contagion

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Convex
```bash
npx convex dev
```
This will prompt you to create a Convex account (free) and set up your project.

### 3. Set up Groq API Key
1. Get a free API key from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com)
2. Add it to your Convex environment:
```bash
npx convex env set GROQ_API_KEY your_api_key_here
```

### 4. Seed the World (Optional)
```bash
npx convex run seed:seedWorld
```
This creates initial NPCs and world state.

### 5. Run the Game
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open the printed localhost URL. Arrow keys / WASD to move. Watch NPCs think, talk, and live their lives!

### Data Flow

1. **World Tick** (every 3 seconds): Move NPCs, age them, update positions
2. **AI Think Tick** (every 8 seconds): 3-5 random NPCs generate thoughts with Groq LLM
3. **God Tick** (every 2 minutes): Spawn new NPCs or trigger events (villains, festivals)
4. **Reaper Tick** (every 30 seconds): Check for deaths based on age/health/stress
5. **Conversation Tick** (every 5 seconds): Check for nearby NPCs and start conversations

## ✨ Emergent Physics Layer

- **Scalar fields (heat / food / trauma)**: `convex/fields.ts` maintains a 30x17 grid that diffuses danger, decays heat, regrows food, and lets trauma linger where bad things happened. NPCs sample these fields every tick to decide where to go.
- **Utility-driven agents**: `convex/drives.ts` replaces LLM movement with hunger, loneliness, curiosity, fear, and faith drives. The best-scoring drive sets a new target while still leaving dialogue to Groq/Mem0.
- **Crowd dynamics**: Separation penalties, herd alarms, and emotional contagion translate local crowd density into organic flocking and clustering. Heat spikes from overcrowded cafés push people outward instead of stacking.
- **Trauma ecology**: Violent or despair events raise trauma fields that decay slowly, feeding back into the dark psychology system in `convex/darkDrives.ts`. Churches become natural refuges as despair climbs.
- **Maintenance loops**: Scheduled jobs diffuse fields, evaporate heat, and rebuild food density so the town breathes over time. Press `F` in-game to visualize the fields, or `T` to paint a trauma cloud instantly.

## 🧠 How It Works
### Personality System (6 Traits)

Each NPC is born with randomized personality traits (0-1 scale):

| Trait | Low | High |
|-------|-----|------|
| **Curiosity** | Stays in comfort zone | Explores actively |
| **Empathy** | Self-focused | Helps others |
| **Boldness** | Cautious, risk-averse | Daring, seeks thrills |
| **Order** | Spontaneous | Likes routine |
| **Mood** | Pessimistic | Optimistic |
| **Weirdness** | Conventional | Eccentric |

Personality influences:
- **Movement decisions**: Curious NPCs explore edges, social NPCs cluster at café
- **Conversation style**: Empathetic NPCs ask about feelings, bold NPCs make jokes
- **Stress response**: High-order NPCs panic during chaos, bold NPCs thrive on it

### AI Decision-Making

NPCs use **Groq's Llama 3.3 70B** model for contextual reasoning:

1. **Context gathering**: Retrieve recent memories from Mem0, check nearby NPCs/events
2. **Prompt construction**: Include personality traits, location, time of day, mood, stress
3. **LLM inference**: Generate thought + action (e.g., "I should check on the café meetup")
4. **Action execution**: Move toward target, start conversation, or idle
5. **Memory storage**: Save thought and action to Mem0 for future recall

Movement now flows through the physics layer—utility scores turn those thoughts into concrete destinations that respect danger, hunger, and social pressure.

**Fallback mode**: If Groq API fails, NPCs still generate movements through drives and can fall back to rule-based chatter.

### Utility Drives & Crowd Physics

- Hunger, loneliness, curiosity, fear, safety, and faith compete each tick; the winner picks a new target (café, park, friends, church, or a safe random spot).
- Heat and trauma fields actively repel NPCs while food gradients pull them in, producing simmering hotspots around crises or long lines at the café.
- Crowding reduces the desire to socialize (boids-style separation) and raises local heat, forcing self-regulating queues and stampedes during panic.
- Emotional contagion averages nearby mood, so one meltdown can drag an entire square toward despair until relief arrives.

### Memory & Gossip

- **Mem0 Cloud** stores semantic memories for each NPC
- When NPCs converse, they **distort gossip** (90% accuracy) to simulate telephone game
- Memories include: conversations, events witnessed, location visits, emotional reactions
- LLM retrieves top 3-5 relevant memories when making decisions

### Socio-Economic World State

The dashboard tracks global metrics calculated from all NPCs:

- **Prosperity**: Average health + inverse population pressure
- **Stability**: Inverse of active events + inverse average stress
- **Happiness**: Average mood + health
- **Tension**: Average stress + active dangerous events
- **Scarcity**: Population pressure + danger level

These metrics create "emotional weather" that affects the whole world's vibe.

### Mortality System

Death probability calculated per tick using:
- **Age risk**: Sigmoid curve (young safe, old risky)
- **Starvation risk**: Health below 30% increases risk
- **Stress risk**: Chronic stress shortens lifespan
- **Danger risk**: Active villain events increase local mortality

NPCs live 10-30 minutes on average (configurable).

## ☄️ Emergent Physics Status

**Live now**:
- Scalar field grid with diffusion, evaporation, and regrowth (`convex/fields.ts`)
- Utility-score movement that slashes LLM token usage while improving crowd believability (`convex/drives.ts`)
- Trauma feedback loops that bleed into despair/aggression calculations (`convex/darkDrives.ts`)
- Field maintenance and visualization hooks wired into the main tick and client overlay

**In exploration**:
1. Weather-front fields (wind / rain) that push NPCs indoors during storms
2. Cooperative work zones that build temporary prosperity hotspots
3. Persistent memorials that slowly heal trauma fields after major tragedies

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**NPCs not moving**:
- Check Convex dashboard - is `worldTick` cron running?
- Run `npx convex dev` to ensure backend is connected

**No AI thoughts**:
- Verify `GROQ_API_KEY` is set: `npx convex env get GROQ_API_KEY`
- Check Groq API quota at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
- Fallback mode should still show rule-based behavior

**Dashboard shows zeros**:
- Run `npx convex run worldState:initializeWorld` to initialize world state
- Spawn NPCs: `npx convex run godEvents:spawnNPC` (repeat 5-10 times)

**Speech bubbles not showing**:
- Open browser console - look for conversation logs
- Ensure NPCs are within 80px of each other (press `D` to see debug circles)

**Field overlay is empty**:
- Let `worldTick` run at least once (start Convex + refresh client)
- Confirm `convex/fields` table exists via Convex dashboard or rerun `npx convex run godEvents:spawnNPC` to kick the scheduler
- Check the browser console for field fetch logs (`F` toggles the overlay)

## ⚙️ Configuration Notes

### Current Setup (Ollama Local LLM)

The project is configured to use **Ollama** (local LLM) via **ngrok tunnel** for maximum privacy and cost control:

- **Model**: `llama3.2:3b` (2GB, fast inference)
- **Tunnel**: Ollama exposed via ngrok for cloud access from Convex
- **Cost**: $0 (runs on your machine)
- **Speed**: ~2-3 seconds per thought

To use Groq instead (faster, cloud-based):
1. Edit [convex/ai.ts:5](convex/ai.ts#L5)
2. Change `const USE_GROQ = false` → `const USE_GROQ = true`
3. Deploy: `npx convex deploy`

### ngrok Setup

Ollama runs locally (port 11434), but Convex backend needs cloud access. ngrok creates a secure tunnel:

```bash
# Start Ollama (if not running)
ollama serve

# Start ngrok tunnel
ngrok http 11434

# Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://xxxx.ngrok.app)
# Update OLLAMA_NGROK_URL in convex/ai.ts
```

**Note**: Free ngrok accounts allow 1 simultaneous tunnel. Paid accounts support multiple.
